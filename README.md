# Basic Neural Network (Fully Connected) for MNIST
Basic neural network (Fully connected) with three hidden layers using tensorflow for python for classifying digits from MNIST data sets with ~95% accuracy.


With three hidden layers, containing 100, 50 and 20 neurons respectively, and training over 100 epochs, this network gives approximately 95% accuracy on the test data of the mnist data set.
